0.7.0
- Added tooltips to all effect parameters
- Installer now allows to install the Post Processing GitHub repository in 2018.1+
- The Help window now allows you to reconfigure the shaders for either Post Processing installations (GitHub/Package Manager). This doesn't force 2018.1+ users to use the Package Manager installation anymore.

Added:
- LUT
	* Use traditional LUT strips for color grading. Includes the option to blend two LUTs over a distance
- Colorize
	* Applies a color gradient to the image (eg. night or thermal vision)
- Fog
	* Added skybox color mode

Changed:
- Light Streaks
	* Fixed intensity parameter behaviour
	* Fixed vertical direction being too short
- Lens Flares
	* Fixed serialization issue
- Color Split
	* Brought offset value into 0-1 range, for consistency
- Posterize
	* Brought intensity value into 0-1 range, for consistency
- Danger
	* Removed refraction parameter 
- Kuwahara
	* Added start/end distance to Depth Fade mode
- Dithering
	* Added Small/Big size options, since values other than 0.5 and 1 induce an interference pattern
	* Effect is now executed before tonemapping for improved luminance threshold response
- Pixelize
	* Reconfigured to work with dynamic resolutions
- Refraction
	* Added option in the absence of a DUDV map, where a supplied normal map can be converted in the shader
- Scanlines
	* Added animation speed parameter

0.6.1

	* Blending modes

Fixed:
- Errors messages for some effects when using HDRP
- Threshold behaviour for Light Streaks and Lens Flares
- Sunshafts
	* Directional Light position influencing origin of sun rays
	* High intensity values causing banding artifacts

0.5.0
Added:
- New effects
	* Sunshafts, radiate sun rays from a directional light and skybox
	* Fog, distance and height-based fog with density noise
	* Clouds shadows, projects a texture over the world (cloud example texture included)
- Screen Gradient
	* Color fields option
	* Rotation parameter
- Overlay
	* Blending modes
	* Tiling parameter

Fixed:
- Single-Pass Stereo rendering fixes for:
	* Light Streaks

Changed:
- Effects dropdown is now grouped in categories
- All effects are now in the SCPE namespace to avoid possible conflicts
- Edge Detection will show a warning for unsupported modes when using LWRP/HDRP
- Ambient Occlusion 2D and Lightshafts are automatically disabled in VR

Removed:
- Fisheye effect (replaced by Unity's Lens Distortion effect)
- Fog Gradient effect (replaced by Fog effect)

0.4.0
Added:
- Auto installation of Post Processing Stack package in Unity 2018.1+

- New effects:
	* Radial Blur
	* Lens flares
